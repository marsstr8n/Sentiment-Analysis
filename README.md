# Sentiment-Analysis

This project is a classification prediction of reviews collected from the three domains: imdb.com, amazon.com, yelp.com. The goal of the assignment is to develop an effective Bag of Words (BoW) feature engineering, and use a binary classifer to predict the sentiment (Positive or Negative) of held-out data.

The assignment is divided into 4 sections:
- Task 1: Data loading and Data preparation
- Task 2: Feature representation
- Task 3: Classification and evaluation
- Task 4: Report

Task 1-3 is displayed in this Jupyter notebook file, with Task 4 submitted in a .pdf file included with the submission. This Jupyter notebook however contains a Task 4 section which includes some code to supplement the report
