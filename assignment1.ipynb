    "This assignment is a classification prediction of reviews collected from the three domains: imdb.com, amazon.com, yelp.com. The goal of the assignment is to develop an effective Bag of Words (BoW) feature engineering, and use a binary classifer to predict the sentiment (Positive or Negative) of held-out data.\n",
